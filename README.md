Library Management System (AVL Tree)

🎓 Academic project developed for the Data Structures course at ISPTEC, focused on the implementation of a library management system using an AVL Tree in C language.

The project applies fundamental data structure concepts, including self-balancing trees, linked lists, and dynamic memory management.

📌 Project Overview

This system simulates a basic library environment, allowing the management of books and book loans.

An AVL Tree is used to store books ordered by ISBN, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and removal operations. A linked list is used to manage borrowed books.

🎯 Objectives
